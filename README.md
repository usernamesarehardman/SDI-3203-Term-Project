# Push-Style Client-Server Chat System

## Overview

This project implements a simple push-style client-server chat application designed for local networks. It allows multiple clients to connect to a single server, register with unique usernames, and exchange messages in real time. The server pushes messages directly to recipients without requiring periodic polling.
